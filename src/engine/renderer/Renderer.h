	/**
	 * @brief A base class for all renderers. This class is responsible for @b frontend rendering of your game. The rendering backend is responsible for the
	 * actual rendering. When using this class, you should inherit from it and implement the `init` and `update` methods. If you want this class to be
	 * multi-threaded by Atlas, you should make sure that the `init` and `update` methods are thread-safe. Additionally, make sure you set
	 * @ref canBeMultiThreaded to @a true if you want this to take effect. If you do not, Atlas will only run the `init` and `update` methods on the rendering
	 * thread instead of accounting for your renderer's need to be multi-threaded.
	 * 
	 * @note Terms used in this class's documentation:
	 * - **renderer thread**: The thread that Atlas uses to draw your game to the screen. 
	 * - **rendering backend**: API wrapper that Atlas uses to draw your game to the screen. For example, Vulkan, Raylib, and OpenGL are all rendering APIs.
	 * - **the renderer**: Either your implementation of this interface class, a wrapper around one, or this class.
	 * 
	 * @since v
	 * 
	 * @sa @ref EngineModule to read the documentation of this class's parent.
