/// \brief The input system for Techstorm.
/// 
/// \details The input system for Techstorm works by a Laissez-faire system where the user can register InputActions (<see cref="InputAction"/>) by using functions as callbacks. The reason for this
/// is because it is much easier to do it this way (and it is also more efficient & flexible). Plus, it also allows you to register multiple callbacks for the same InputAction, which may be useful.
