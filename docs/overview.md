## What is Techstorm {#what-is-techstorm}

---

Techstorm is the response to the lack of a free game engine that is built for large open worlds. While Unity or Unreal can make open world games, there are alot of hoops that must be jumped through first, which is why there is a need for it.  Techstorm aims to be flexible and moldable to suit needs without having to make major changes. It also aims to be easy to work with and a limited number of complex components.

## Architecture {#architecture}

---

### Building {#building}

---

#### Automatic Building {#automatic-building}

The building process of Techstorm is simple because of a provided Python script. To run said script, go to the directory where you cloned the repository in a command line application. Once there, simply run:
```
$ python3 Build.py
```
This is all you will need to do because it will do the following:
* Install & setup Conan if not already done
* Install & build packages
	* For both Debug and Release
* Configure, build, and generate the CMake project
* Open VS2022 solution

Keep in mind this **will** take a while for the first time, so go drink water (We know that you have not done this yet today), go for a quick walk, or go to the bathroom. Once this is done, that is it! Pretty easy, right?

#### Manual Building

---

> The following instructions are **NOT YET COMPLETE**. For now, please see \ref automatic-building

In the event that you would like to build directly, start at what ever point you would like.

##### Installing And Setting Up Conan {#installing-and-setting-up-conan}

---

The following instructions are based on Conan 2.9's documentation. If you would like to use their documentation to install Conan, please see [their installation tutorial](https://docs.conan.io/2/tutorial/consuming_packages/build_simple_cmake_project.html). With that said, first make sure that you have python by using:

```
$ python3 --version
```

If you got an error, congrats! You do not have python. If it worked and you have a version greater than or equal to 3.6, please run:

```
$ pip install conan
```

> According to their documentation, ensure your **pip version** matches your **python version**. 

### Flow {#flow-architecture}

Due to the inherent nature of Techstorm, the architecture can be complex. In terms of building, there are a few things that are required to understand how Techstorm works. There are 4 groups that are used to build the engine, as outlined below:
- Application
- Engine
- Project
- Tools
The Application is responsible for loading the engine and handling the project, as seen below.

### File System Architecture {#file-system-architecture}

---

>**The design of the file system will cause errors if it is used improperly. As a result, it is highly encouraged that this is read very carefully. **

As of now, the file system works by recursively searching the "game" folder in the root directory (Techstorm-v5). The folder will contain the "assets" and "data" sub-directories, wherein you will put assets and data files.  Any file that is within the search area will be registered.  For a detailed analysis of how it works, please see \ref detailed-file-registry.

When it comes to file loading, the **extension matters**. This is because the \ref FileSystemRegistry loads files based on the loading function assigned to the extension. For this reason, when getting the file, you must have the filename along with the extension or just the extension (highly discouraged, see \ref why-not-extensions). For this example, \c ExampleFile.txt will be used to represent a file. In order to get a file, please see below:
 
```
std::shared_ptr<RegisteredFile> file = GetFileSystemRegistry().getFile("ExampleFile.txt");
```

### Graphics Architecture {#graphics-architecture}

---

#### Graphics Introduction {#graphics-introduction}

---

Despite the fact Techstorm tries to make graphics easier, it can become complex due to the nature of 3D graphics. For this reason, it is imperative that you read this carefully in order to reduce future headache. In addition, if you are not well versed in how OpenGL and Raylib works, please read the online book/tutorial [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/) and \ref using-raylib respectably.

## Code Conventions {#code-conventions}

---

Techstorm tries to be as easy to read as possible by making the code read similarly to English (This is mandatory for engine contributions!). In addition, Techstorm tries to be intuitive and understandable at a quick glance, hence it uses PascalCase and CamelCase. As such, the code conventions are simple and intuitive. The only exception is with broad cases. 

Broad cases should only be used as long as there are no other applicable cases. For example, a private static variable. This variable would look like a static type variable rather than a private variable. That means it should be named with a prefix of "s" rather than a 'm'. However, please note that this only applies when the "Notes" section contains "Broad case". Additionally, There are some other important distinctions, definitions, and use cases that must be followed to stay compliant, as seen below.

### Functions {#functions}

---

Functions are simple, any that are not bound to a specific object will have the first letter lowercase. If it is a static, namespace, or global function, then it will have the first letter capitalized instead. When it comes to Preprocessor functions, it will follow the same rules as Constant Global variables, as seen below:
