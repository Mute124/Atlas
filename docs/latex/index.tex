\doxylink{namespace_techstorm}{Techstorm} is the response to the lack of a free game engine that is built for large open worlds. While Unity or Unreal can make open world games, there are alot of hoops that must be jumped through first, which is why there is a need for it. \doxylink{namespace_techstorm}{Techstorm} aims to be flexible and moldable to suit needs without having to make major changes. It also aims to be easy to work with and a limited number of complex components.

The architecture of \doxylink{namespace_atlas}{Atlas} can get complex at some points, but the documentation is extensive to make up for this and reduce the learning curve.\hypertarget{index_flow-architecture}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{\#\#\# Flow}{\#\#\# Flow}}\label{index_flow-architecture}
Due to the inherent nature of \doxylink{namespace_techstorm}{Techstorm}, the architecture can be complex. In terms of building, there are a few things that are required to understand how \doxylink{namespace_techstorm}{Techstorm} works. There are 4 groups that are used to build the engine, as outlined below\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Application
\item Engine
\item \doxylink{class_project}{Project}
\item Tools The Application is responsible for loading the engine and handling the project, as seen below.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}\+The design of the file system will cause errors if it is used improperly. As a result, it is highly encouraged that this is read very carefully. \texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}

As of now, the file system works by recursively searching the "{}game"{} folder in the root directory (Techstorm-\/v5). The folder will contain the "{}assets"{} and "{}data"{} sub-\/directories, wherein you will put assets and data files. Any file that is within the search area will be registered. Another piece of important information is that the {\bfseries{filesystem is sandboxed}}. As of version 0.\+0.\+3, the only directory that is accessible is the {\itshape game} directory within the root directory. This is a safety feature that protects against malicious mods. Furthermore, this reduces the need to have long strings that lead to a specific path.

\doxylink{namespace_atlas}{Atlas} provides {\bfseries{three}} methods of searching\+: by full path, sandboxed path, extension (highly discouraged because it does not account for duplicates), and filename. Sandboxed searching is the most recommended because it will only return those that are within the {\ttfamily game} directory. It is also much safer in general because it is contained to a single root folder that does not give mods the ability to mess with the user\textquotesingle{}s operating system or the game itself (besides modifying config and assets). \hypertarget{index_file-loading}{}\doxyparagraph{\texorpdfstring{File Loading}{File Loading}}\label{index_file-loading}
\DoxyHorRuler{0}


When it comes to files, there are two types of files\+: registered and loaded. During the searching phase, all files found become registered (unless their extension is marked to be immediately loaded). When the file is used for the first time, it immediately becomes loaded. A visual representation of the file loading step is below\+:

 
\begin{DoxyImage}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=\textheight/2,keepaspectratio=true]{FileSystemFlowChart.png}
\doxyfigcaption{Atlas\textquotesingle{}s file system high level flow chart}
\end{DoxyImage}
   

Next, the topic of immediate loading needs to be discussed. Immediate loading is when the file system loads a file on registration if the extension is marked as such. In order to mark an extension to be immediately loaded, it must be done {\bfseries{PRIOR TO THE SEARCHING PHASE}}. This is done within the {\bfseries{pre-\/initialization step}}. Below is an example of this in action\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{//\ includes\ ...}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{//\ project.h\ in\ the\ project\_lib\ project}
\DoxyCodeLine{class\ Project\ final\ :\ public\ Atlas::IProject\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{public:}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ void\ preInit()\ override\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ IProject::preInit();}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ }
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ using\ namespace\ std;}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ }
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ //\ the\ first\ parameter\ is\ the\ extension\ that\ should\ be\ immediately\ loaded}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ AddFileRegistryLoadFunction("{}txt"{},\ [](std::shared\_ptr<FileMeta>\ fileMeta)\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ //\ any\ casting\ is\ important\ here!}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ return\ std::any\_cast<string>(LoadFileText(fileMeta-\/>path.c\_str()));}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \});}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ }
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ //\ ...}
\DoxyCodeLine{\};}

\end{DoxyCode}


As can be seen, the {\ttfamily Add\+File\+Registry\+Load\+Function()} is being called, with the extension and the corresponding loading function being passed. The file system is Laissez-\/faire in that it requires you to bring your own function to load extensions. Keep in mind that the any casting must be done here because Registered\+File uses an std\+::any as a container for the data. Other than that, \doxylink{namespace_atlas}{Atlas} handles the rest.

When it comes to file loading, the {\bfseries{extension matters}}. This is because the File\+System\+Registry loads files based on the loading function assigned to the extension. For this reason, when getting the file, you must have the filename along with the extension, just the extension (highly discouraged, see why-\/not-\/extensions), the exact path, and the sandboxed path. For this example, {\ttfamily Example\+File.\+txt} will be used to represent a file. In order to get a file, please see below\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{std::shared\_ptr<RegisteredFile>\ file\ =\ GetFileSystemRegistry().getFile("{}ExampleFile.txt"{});}

Despite the fact \doxylink{namespace_techstorm}{Techstorm} tries to make graphics easier, it can become complex due to the nature of 3D graphics. For this reason, it is imperative that you read this carefully in order to reduce future headache. In addition, if you are not well versed in how Open\+GL and Raylib works, please read the online book/tutorial \href{https://learnopengl.com/}{\texttt{ Learn Open\+GL}} and using-\/raylib respectably. ~\newline


First, the mechanics of how \doxylink{namespace_atlas}{Atlas} handles rendering must be discussed. \doxylink{namespace_atlas}{Atlas} is a modular engine, which means that there are many individual classes that can be overridden to modify the engine. For a list of these, please see atlas-\/modules. The {\ttfamily rendering} and {\ttfamily game object} system is heavy in this respect because there is alot of moving parts. A {\ttfamily renderer} in atlas can be also thought as a backend. By default, the provided renderer is built off of raylib. If you would like to implement your own rendering backend, please do so by overriding the /ref IRenderer class.\hypertarget{index_using-models}{}\doxyparagraph{\texorpdfstring{Using Models}{Using Models}}\label{index_using-models}

\doxylink{namespace_atlas}{Atlas} makes models easy because it will automatically handle materials for it. \hypertarget{index_autotoc_md9}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Modding Architecture}{Modding Architecture}}\label{index_autotoc_md9}

Since Tech\+Storm comes with modding capability out of the box, there is less that has to be worried about. However, it is up to you to ensure that it is used properly. As of version 0.\+0.\+7, Angel\+Script is NOT yet implemented and there is no functionality for it yet. \hypertarget{index_dependencies}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Dependencies}{Dependencies}}\label{index_dependencies}

This section serves as an insight into why things are the way they are. Usually, documentation just describes the whats, wheres, and whos, but \doxylink{namespace_techstorm}{Techstorm} is extensively documented! This section will try to be as clear and thorough as possible in explaining the logic behind the design. The hope is that if you know the thinking, then you are able to know how it works and how to exploit it.\hypertarget{index_code-conventions}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Code Conventions}{Code Conventions}}\label{index_code-conventions}
\DoxyHorRuler{0}


\doxylink{namespace_techstorm}{Techstorm} tries to be as easy to read as possible by making the code read similarly to English (This is mandatory for engine contributions!). In addition, \doxylink{namespace_techstorm}{Techstorm} tries to be intuitive and understandable at a quick glance, hence it uses Pascal\+Case and Camel\+Case. As such, the code conventions are simple and intuitive. The only exception is with broad cases.

Broad cases should only be used as long as there are no other applicable cases. For example, a private static variable. This variable would look like a static type variable rather than a private variable, meaning it should be named with a prefix of "{}s"{} rather than a \textquotesingle{}m\textquotesingle{}. However, please note that this only applies when the "{}\+Notes"{} section contains "{}\+Broad case"{}. Additionally, There are some other important distinctions, definitions, and use cases that must be followed to stay compliant, as seen below.\hypertarget{index_important-convention-use-cases}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Important Convention Use Cases}{Important Convention Use Cases}}\label{index_important-convention-use-cases}

Functions are simple, any that are not bound to a specific object will have the first letter lowercase. If it is a static, namespace, or global function, then it will have the first letter capitalized instead. When it comes to Preprocessor functions, it will follow the same rules as Constant Global variables, as seen below\+:
