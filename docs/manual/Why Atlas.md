# Why use Atlas? {#why-use-atlas}

---

Atlas is the response to the lack of a free game engine that is built for large open worlds. While Unity or Unreal can make open world games, there are a lot of hoops that must be jumped through first, which is why there is a need for it.  Atlas aims to be flexible and moldable to suit needs without having to make major changes. It also aims to be easy to work with and a limited number of complex components. 

## Performance {#atlas-performance}

Even small open-world games take alot of processing power, which is exactly why Atlas utilizes the same complex computing methods that scientific institutions (ie. NASA, CERN, etc) use to simulate the universe and it's complex behaviors. While the average person does not have a super-computer in their mom's basement, Atlas will not be running simulations that are more complex than those used to simulate entropy. This ensures that developers and players are guaranteed the best performance that Atlas can offer. 

## Developer Experience {#atlas-developer-experience}

Atlas is also built with the belief that a good developer experience directly translates to good player experience and development performance. Atlas is also based on the concept of pseudo-laissez-faire. Everything required to get the engine up and running is already provided, but the developer can do what they please and write their own implementation of the engine.
